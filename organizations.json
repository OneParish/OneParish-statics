Present in Palestine in around 1050, it is a lay religious Order, traditionally of military, chivalrous, and noble nature.  Its 12,500 members include Professed Friars and others who have made vows of obedience.  The other Knights and Dames are lay members, devoted to the exercise of Christian virtue and charity.  What distinguishes the Knights and Dames of Malta is their commitment to reaching their spiritual perfection within the Church and to expending their energies serving the poor and the sick. ",
